# Streamlabs-Chatbot-Randombeer
A Python Script for Streamlabs Chatbot to gift some random user a "Beer" (similar to currencies by SL Chatbot)

# Changelog

**v0.0.1**

* initial Build

**v0.0.2 [WIP]**

* [x] parse first command
* [x] check if randuser is already in file then plus 1
* [ ] if not add line with viewer name and set to 1
* [ ] parse second command:
* [ ] check file for given username and print out value

**Future ideas:**

* Trigger gifs on !randombeer command
* outputting 1., 2. and 3. as "first" "second" and "third" (hopefully low hanging fruits)
* blacklist users (maybe with streamlabs blacklist) to exclude bots from getting beer (what a shame!)
* combination with currency system from sl chatbot? 
* !top10beers
* More exception handling and debug information for streamers
